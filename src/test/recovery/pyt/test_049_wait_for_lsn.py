"""Port of src/test/recovery/t/049_wait_for_lsn.pl.

Exercises the WAIT FOR LSN command: the standby_replay/standby_write/
standby_flush modes on a standby and primary_flush on a primary, timeouts and
no_throw status reporting, subtransaction cleanup, parameter/mode validation,
many concurrent waiters per mode, promotion terminating standby waiters,
archive-only standbys (replay-position floor), fresh-shmem walreceiver startup,
off-by-one fencepost boundaries, and a timeline switch on a cascade standby.

The Perl test detects waiter completion by logging from a follow-up function;
here a blocked waiter is dispatched with ``background_sql()`` and its completion
observed by resolving the returned future, so the log helpers are unnecessary.
