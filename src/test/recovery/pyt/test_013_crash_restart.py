"""Port of src/test/recovery/t/013_crash_restart.pl.

Tests that the postmaster performs a crash-restart cycle when a backend dies
unexpectedly (SIGQUIT and SIGKILL of a backend), that committed data survives
while in-progress transactions do not, that shared_preload_libraries are
re-initialized, and that background workers (the logical replication launcher)
come back.

Two sessions are used as in the Perl test: ``killme`` holds the backend that
gets signalled, and a one-shot background query plays the "monitor" role: its
failure signals that the crash-restart has begun.
