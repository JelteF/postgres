"""Port of src/test/recovery/t/031_recovery_conflict.pl.

Test that connections to a hot standby are correctly canceled when a recovery
conflict is detected, and that pg_stat_database_conflicts is populated. Each
conflict type kills the standby session that triggers it, so a fresh background
session is opened per scenario (the Perl test reconnects one psql).
