class TAP:
    """
    A basic API for reporting via the TAP 12 protocol[1].

    Reporting a newer version like "TAP version 14"[2] here is not even
    possible, despite every meson version accepting it, because meson requires
    that line to be the literal first line of output and testwrap prints a
    comment like this before it:

        # executing test ...

    We could of course modify testwrap to report TAP version 14, but that would
    not buy us much currently. The main feature that could be useful to us is
    subtests, but no meson version implements those[3]: before meson 1.0.0
    their indented lines were hard parse errors that failed the test, and since
    then[4] they are simply ignored with a warning.
