        Initialize a PostgreSQL server instance. Call start() to actually
        start the server.

        Args:
            name: The name of this server instance (for logging purposes)
            basedir: Directory holding everything belonging to this server:
                the data directory (``pgdata``), base backups taken from it
                (``backup``), and archived WAL (``archives``). Like Perl's
                per-node basedir, it must be unique per server *and* per test
                file, since under autoconf's make check the whole suite shares
                one tmp_check directory.
            sockdir: Path to directory for Unix sockets
            libpq_handle: ctypes handle to libpq
            hostaddr: If provided, use this specific address (e.g., "127.0.0.2")
            port: If provided, use this port instead of finding a free one,
                is currently only allowed if hostaddr is also provided
            initdb_opts: Extra arguments to pass to initdb (e.g.
                ["--locale=C", "--encoding=LATIN1"]). When provided the fast
                INITDB_TEMPLATE copy is bypassed and a real initdb is run, since
                the template was created with the default locale/encoding.
            from_backup: Path to a base backup (as produced by
                ``PostgresServer.backup()``) to copy into the data directory
                instead of running initdb. Use this to build a standby or a
                point-in-time-recovery node.
            streaming_primary: When building from a backup, the upstream server
                to stream WAL from. Sets ``primary_conninfo`` and creates a
                ``standby.signal`` file so the node starts as a streaming
                standby. Its ``application_name`` is this node's name, so the
                primary can ``wait_for_catchup()`` on it by name.
            allows_streaming: Configure this server to act as a replication
                primary (``wal_log_hints`` plus generous ``max_wal_senders`` /
                ``max_replication_slots``). The defaults already permit basic
                streaming; this mirrors Perl's ``init(allows_streaming => 1)``.
                Pass the string ``"logical"`` (like Perl's
                ``allows_streaming => 'logical'``) to set ``wal_level = logical``
                instead of ``replica``; any other truthy value configures plain
                physical streaming.
            archiving: Enable WAL archiving (``archive_mode = on`` plus an
                ``archive_command`` that copies segments into this server's
                ``archive_dir``). Mirrors Perl's ``enable_archiving``.
            restoring: When building from a backup, the upstream server whose
                ``archive_dir`` to restore WAL from (sets ``restore_command``).
                Mirrors Perl's ``init_from_backup(..., has_restoring => 1)``,
                which defaults ``standby => 1``, so by default a
                ``standby.signal`` is dropped (the node keeps replaying archived
                WAL as a standby). Pass ``restoring_standby=False`` for a
                ``recovery.signal`` instead (archive recovery that promotes when
                WAL runs out). Either way, setting a recovery target via ``conf``
                with ``recovery_target_action = promote`` performs PITR.
            restoring_standby: See ``restoring``.
            conf: Extra GUC settings (a ``{name: value}`` dict) to append to
                postgresql.conf before the first start, applied via
                ``append_conf`` so values are escaped automatically. Use for
                settings that must be present at startup, such as a
                point-in-time recovery target (``recovery_target_lsn`` etc.),
                since ``create_pg`` starts the server immediately.
